# midi2mqtt

[![License][mit-badge]][mit-url]
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/midi2mqtt.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/midi2mqtt)

This is a simple bridge between a MIDI device and MQTT. Right now it only supports `noteon` `noteoff`
`poly aftertouch` and `cc` messages.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js >= 10.13.0 (including npm). 
* MIDI device connected and showing up when running e.g. `amidi -l`
* All pre-requisites from the node-midi package, including the libasound2-dev package if on Linux

### Install:    
Run `sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g midi2mqtt`. Note that you may need to first run `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev`
to satisfy dependancies of the Node.js midi library.


### Start:	
First run `midi2mqtt --help` to see how the program is used.
* You will likely need to specify the MIDI device (`-d`)
* You can also specify the MQTT topic prefix with `-t`, including slashes (e.g. `-t "home/midi"`).

If you do not know the MIDI port names on your system, you can simply run `midi2mqtt` and look for the
messages about avaialble MIDI input and output devices.

Simply press `ctrl-c` to exit the application on the command line.

### Example command line:  
`midi2mqtt -t "house/midi" -b "mqtt://mqtt-server" -u username -p topsecret -d "Midi Fighter 3D 20:0"`

## Topics and Payloads

### Updates from MIDI device to MQTT (read-only)

Topics take the form `<topic>/out/<channel>/<type>/<parameter> <value>`
where \<topic\> defaults to 'midi', \<channel\> is the MIDI channel (0-15), \<type\> is one
of 'noteon', 'noteoff', etc., \<parameter\> depends on type, and \<value\> is the message payload
which also depends on type.

Currently supported topics are as follows:
	<topic>/out/<channel>/noteon/<note> <velocity>
	<topic>/out/<channel>/noteoff/<note> <velocity>
	<topic>/out/<channel>/poly_aftertouch/<note> <pressure>
	<topic>/out/<channel>/cc/<controller> <value>


### Commands from MQTT to MIDI device (write-only)

Topics take the form `<topic>/in/<channel>/<type>/<parameter> <value>`
where \<topic\> defaults to 'midi', \<channel\> is the MIDI channel (0-15), \<type\> is one
of 'noteon', 'noteoff', etc., \<parameter\> depends on type, and \<value\> is the message payload
which also depends on type.

Currently supported topics are as follows:
	<topic>/in/<channel>/noteon/<note> <velocity>
	<topic>/in/<channel>/noteoff/<note> <velocity>
	<topic>/in/<channel>/poly_aftertouch/<note> <pressure>
	<topic>/in/<channel>/cc/<controller> <value>


### Special-purpose topics

#### \<topic\>/connected
Read-only status of the program:
* `1` when program is up
* `0` when the program exits or MQTT disconnects


## Starting at boot

You can easily start this program on boot using systemd.  
  
First, as root, create `/usr/lib/systemd/system/midi2mqtt.service` with the following contents:

	[Unit]
	Description=Bridge from MIDI to MQTT
	Wants=network-online.target
	After=network-online.target
	
	[Service]
	Type=simple
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/midi2mqtt -t "midi" -b "http://mqtt-server" -d "MIDI Device Name"
	Restart=always
	User=<user>
	Group=<group>
	
	# Give a reasonable amount of time for the server to start up/shut down
	TimeoutSec=300
	
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

**Note:** Be sure to edit the midi2mqtt command line args to match your setup as well as
change the User and Group to what the program should run as.
